I studied informatics at [Babes Bolyai University of Cluj][ubb] between 2013-2017 .

<br />

The main subjects that I learned where mathematics, algorithms, data structures, design patters, networking and operation systems, programming languages (Java, C#, c++, python, PHP, JS, Lisp, Prolog, Visual Basic, Bash) and databases (Microsoft SQL, MySql)

<br />
<br />

I did my apprenticeship for [ISJ Cluj][isj] where my team an I implemented a forum for their internal use.
We used PHP and the phpBB forum software (with their custom needs teaks) for the backend and basic HTML, CSS and Javascript for the frontend.

<br />
<br />

I also came 3rd on a programming competition organised by the [Babes Bolyai University of Cluj][ubb] competing against other Informatics students who did their apprenticeship with the [PRACT-IT][pract-it] programee.

<br />

At the end of 2015 I started working at [SoftVision][sv] and dropped out on studying.
