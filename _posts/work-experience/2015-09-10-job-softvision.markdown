I started working at [SoftVision][sv] in November 2015 after a pre-employment training / bootcamp on web technologies. 
<br />
<br />
We worked in an agile way as an extension to the client's team for a CRM solution.<br />
I mainly did maintenance work fixing front/back end bugs on the modules my team were responsible for. 
<br />
<br />
Also, I implemented a few new requirements and spent my time getting familiar with:

* Linux
* PHP
* DB2
* JavaScript (JQuery)
* JavaScript (Backbone)
* Python
* Git
* composer
* DB2
* Jira
* HTML/CSS

<br/>

I stopped working on the CRM project in January 2017 so I decided to change my job as a Web Developer for [Altom][altom].
