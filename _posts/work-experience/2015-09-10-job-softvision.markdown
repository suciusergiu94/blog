I started working at [SoftVision][sv] in november 2015 after a pre-employment training / bootcamp on web technologies. 
<br />
<br />
We worked in an agile way as an extension to the client's team for CRM solution.<br />
I mainly did support fixing front and backend bugs on the modules my team were responsible for. 
<br />
But I also implemented a few developement tasks and took my time beeing familiar with:
<br />
<br />

* Linux
* PHP
* DB2
* JavaScript (JQuery)
* JavaScript (Backbone)
* Git
* composer
* DB2
* HTML/CSS

<br/>

In January 2017, I stoped working on the CRM project so I decided to change my job as well as a Web Developer for [Altom][altom].
