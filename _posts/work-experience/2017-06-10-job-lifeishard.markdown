In June 2017 I started working at [Life is hard][lih] as a PHP Developer.
<br/>
I mainly worked fullstack both doing development and support on various projects using PHP for backend and and JQuery + Bootstrap for frontend.
<br>
Here I've worked on both company products and software for different clients in the fields of:&nbsp;&nbsp;road/railroad transportation and online auctioning.
<br />
<br />
Technologies and methodologies I've worked with:

* Linux
* Git
* PHP
* Symfony components
* Tailwind.css
* Laravel
* Docker
* Python
* MySQL
* Redis
* Jira

<br />
<br />
I currently work here.
