In June 2017 I started working at [Life is hard][lih] as a PHP Developer.
<br/>
I'm mainly working fullstack both doing development and support on various projects. Mostly I'm using PHP for backend and and JQuery + Bootstrap for frontend trying to migrate to tailwind, and Vue.
<br>
Here I am working on both company products and software for different clients in the fields of:&nbsp;&nbsp;road/railroad transportation and online auctioneering.
<br />
<br />
Technologies and methodologies I've worked with:

* Linux
* Git
* PHP
* Symfony components
* Tailwind.css
* Laravel
* Docker
* Python
* MySQL
* Redis
* Jira
