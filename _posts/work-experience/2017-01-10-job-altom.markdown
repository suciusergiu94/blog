I started working at [Altom][altom] as a Web Developer in Jannuary 2017.
<br/>
<br/>
I was responsible with some maintenance work on their wordpress company site alongside with developing an internal [SBTM][sbtm] chrome / developer tools app.
<br />
<br />
Technologies and methodologies I've worked with:

* Node.js
* Git
* Ember.js
* Electron
* MongoDB
* Docker
* TDD
* Worldpress
<br />
<br />

I stopped working for Altom in March 2017 and took a small break. After that I started working at [Life is hard, Work Soft][lih] which is my current Job.
