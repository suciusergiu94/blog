I started working at [Altom][altom] as a Web Developer in Jannuary 2017.
<br/>
<br/>
I was responsible with some maintanance work on their wordpress company site alongside with developing an internal [SBTM][sbtm] chrome / developer tools app.
<br />
<br />
Technologies and methodologies I've worked with:

* Node.js
* Git
* Ember.js
* Electron
* MongoDB
* Docker
* TDD
* Worldpress

In March 2017 I've stoped working for Altom, took a small break, started working for [Life is hard, Work Soft][lih].
